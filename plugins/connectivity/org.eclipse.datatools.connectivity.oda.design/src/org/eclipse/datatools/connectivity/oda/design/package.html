[<b>Platform API</b>] Defines an Open Data Access (ODA) design session
that allows a custom ODA designer tool to specify the
slice of data to access at run-time.  
<p>
The ODA design-time framework provides the capability for a
third-party data source provider to optionally provide its own
custom designer.  An ODA custom designer is a data-source-specific 
query builder that provides own custom UI for an user to explore its 
meta-data and build a data set query.  
Most of the metadata are specific to individual data sources.
A custom designer is expected to encapsulate the specific knowledge and 
context of its underlying data source.  
<br>An ODA host uses a generic set of design 
information for its data access.  The data access design 
is modeled and defined in this ODA Design Session API.
<p>
When a new data source is designed, an ODA design-time host application
would initiate and request a new ODA design session with the data source's custom
ODA designer.  An user would step through the data-source-specific
design task in a custom ODA designer.  When finished, a data access design 
is created and passed to the ODA host in a response to the 
design session it has initiated.
<p>
The ODA host would in turn adapt the data access design to its
host-specific design components and persistent format.
<br>The data access design may be edited in a later design session.
An ODA host would request another design session, and pass the
last session's pertinent information to the custom ODA designer.
After a user completes editing of the data access design, a revised
design is again passed to the ODA host for updates.
<p>
The <code>OdaDesignSession</code> interface is the starting point of 
the API in the ODA design-time framework.  It contains a
<code>DesignSessionRequest</code> and <code>DesignSessionResponse</code>,
each of which contains pertinent design session information and 
a <code>DataAccessDesign</code>.
