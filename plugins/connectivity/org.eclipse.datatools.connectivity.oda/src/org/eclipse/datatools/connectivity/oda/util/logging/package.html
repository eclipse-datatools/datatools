Provides a trace logging utility to an 
ODA runtime extension.
<p>
The package provides a default implementation of trace logging framework,
which does not impose dependency on other packages or specific platforms.
<br>It may serve to encapsulate the type of logging framework used, 
by simply extending its implementation.  
Each ODA runtime driver is then not required to make any direct changes when
switching to another logging framework. 
<p> 
The use of this logging utility is purely optional.  
An ODA runtime driver extension may directly use its driver-specific logging 
utility, as appropriate.
