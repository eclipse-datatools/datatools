A utility component for accessing the content of an 
ODA data source UI extension's manifest.
<br>
It can be used by an ODA consumer and/or a data provider
to discover the plug-in extension configuration.
<p>
The utility's initial entry point is the singleton <code>UIManifestExplorer</code>.
It provides the service to explore all the static
ODA data source UI extensions, and access to each 
extension's configuration information specified 
in its plug-in manifest file.
<br>  
The content of such ODA data source UI extension configuration
is encapsulated in an <code>UIExtensionManifest</code> and its
associated objects.
